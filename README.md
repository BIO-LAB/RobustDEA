README for RobustDEA  Li Zhang (lizhang@njfu.edu.cn)

RobustDEA is a fast and robust method for finding differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq Data.

RobustDEA selects four DE methods: DESeq2, edgeR, voom and NOISeq. Therefore, users need install the four R packages before running RobustDEA commands. 

Then, you can run a example as follow:
> source('RobustDEA.runExample.R')


The RobustDEA algorithm is developed and implemented by Li Zhang.
